BasysRacingRig is a student project for the Digital Electronics Systems 2 course, using a Basys3 FPGA board to create a racing simulator controller. It tracks steering wheel and pedal positions with encoders, communicates via UART, and displays telemetry on VGA. Built with SystemVerilog and Python for real-time interaction.
